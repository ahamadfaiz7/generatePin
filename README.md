This project provides a very simple application to generate a batch of Unique 4 digit pins based on the inputted number
of pins to be generated. 
The project has maven based structure and will be compiled as a jar which can be used else
where. 
The class which has the logic to generate pins implements an Interface which may have more methods in future to
be implemented. 

Test cases are written to ensure :
1. The number of pins generated as expected.
2. The pins in the list are not duplicate.
3. The pins have all size 4.
